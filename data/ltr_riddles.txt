I am footsteps. The more you take, the more you leave behind.
I am darkness. The more you have of me, the less you see.
I am fire. I am not alive, but I grow. I don’t have lungs, but I need air. I don’t have a mouth, but water kills me.
I am a towel. I get wetter the more I dry.
I am a candle. I become shorter the longer I live.
I am breath. I am light as a feather, yet the strongest man can’t hold me for much longer than a minute.
I am the wind. I am invisible, but you can feel me. I am intangible, but you can hear me.
I am a piano. I have keys but open no locks.
I am fog. The more of me there is, the less you see.
I am the future. I am always in front of you, but you can never see me.
I am a cloud. I don’t have wings, but I can fly. I don’t have eyes, but I can cry. Wherever I go, darkness follows me.
I am a battery. I am not alive, but I can die.
I am a heart. I can be stolen, but I can’t be touched.
I am the letter "M." I am something that comes once in a minute, twice in a moment, but never in a thousand years.
I am a promise. I can be cracked, but never broken.
I am your shadow. I am always with you, but I can’t be seen.
I am a footprint. I’m small but I can cover miles.
I am a secret. The more you have of me, the less you know.
I am light. I’m something that can fill a room, but I don’t take up space.
I am your name. I am always with you, but you never see me. I can be forgotten, but I never leave.
I am silence. The more of me there is, the less you hear.
I am a stamp. I can travel around the world while staying in the corner.
I am a code. I am something that can be cracked, but I can’t be touched.
I am sound. I am something you can hear, but not touch. I can be loud or soft, but I can never be seen.
I am the present moment. I am something that you can never keep, no matter how hard you try.
I am a rumor. I am not alive, but I grow. I don’t have a mouth, but I can speak.
I am a clock. I am always running, but I never move.
I am a hole. I get bigger the more you take away.
I am understanding. I can’t be seen, but I can be felt. I have no color, but I make things clear.
I am a pencil. I get smaller the more you use me.
I am a promise. I can be broken without being touched.
I am time. I am something that everyone has, but no one can keep forever.
I am a thought. I can be light as a feather, but even the strongest hands cannot hold me.
I am a debt. The more you take from me, the greater I become.
I am the horizon. I am often in front of you, but I’m never within reach.
I am the sky. You can see me every day, but I will never be seen the same way twice.
I am a reputation. I am not alive, but I grow over time.
I am a feeling. I can’t be touched, but I can touch everything.
I am a look. I never speak, but I can communicate.
I am a deadline. I can be hard, but I am not solid.
