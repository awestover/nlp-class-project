The more you have of me, the less you know. What am I? A secret.
I’m something that can fill a room, but I don’t take up space. What am I? Light.
I am always with you, but you never see me. I can be forgotten, but I never leave. What am I? Your name.

I am something that you can never keep, no matter how hard you try. What am I? The present moment.
I am not alive, but I grow. I don’t have a mouth, but I can speak. What am I? A rumor.
